 Problem Statement 1
 A Real Time Operating System is often required when an embedded system performs various event driven functionalities and FreeRTOS is one of the most ubiquitous
 Real Time Operating Systems for embedded systems. This assignment involves you showcasing the know-how (or the ability to gather said know-how) of the basic
 intricacies of using RTOS.
 Consider the following Tasks and its corresponding Task Handle:

 What is to be done:
 What is to be done:
 Create Tasks ExampleTask1
 ExampleTask1 and ExampleTask2
 Create Queue Queue1
 ExampleTask2 as per above prototypes and handles. Priority levels of the task at your discretion.
 ExampleTask1 sends data to Queue1
 Queue1 with the above properties mentioned (FreeRTOS Queue).
 ExampleTask1
 Queue1 at a rate of once every 500ms. The delay between each send needs to be exact. The members of the structure are
 populated by global variables G_DataID;
 G_DataID; and G_DataValue;
 ExampleTask2
 ExampleTask2 takes data from Queue2
 G_DataValue; Assume that these variables are updated elsewhere.
 Queue2 whenever data is available, and applies the following logic to the data gathered:
 Condition
 Condition
 Action
 Action
 if(dataID==0)
 Delete ExampleTask2
 if(dataID==1)
 Allow the processing of DataValue Member
 if(DataValue==0)
 Increase the Priority of ExampleTask2 by 2 from the value given to it at
 creation
 if(DataValue==1)
 Decrease the Priority of ExampleTask2 ifif previously increased
 if(DataValue==2)
 Delete ExampleTask2
 At every evaluation, add a print statement to print out dataID
 dataID and DataValue
 DataValue
